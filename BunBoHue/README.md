Let it simmer and periodically check the meats for doneness and remove them as they finish cooking. The pork should be done after about an hour, the beef can vary between 2-3 hours.
After all the meat has removed, let it cool, then slice it. Adjust seasoning and add water to the broth pot if necessary.
Make the aromatics & coloring then add it to the pot.
Boil noodles according to package instructions.
Assemble your bowl, and serve with herbs and veg on a side platter.

Pork Blood (Huyet / Tiet)
The easiest thing to do is just buy it already cooked and boil just to heat it up. If you use the raw type like we did for this recipe, cut into 1" cubes and boil for 30-45 minutes

Avoid adding little fronds (that look like mini bananas), removing them as you encounter them. They taste bitter!
